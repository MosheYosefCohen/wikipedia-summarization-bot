Python bot to provide reliable summarized extracts from Wikipedia using OpenAI API.

# Reliable Wikipedia Summarization Bot

This bot generates reliable summarized extracts from Wikipedia articles using Python and the OpenAI API.

# Why This Bot?

The key goal of this project is to provide users with summaries of Wikipedia articles that accurately and concisely encapsulate the core information. Reliability is emphasized over creative paraphrasing.

# How it Works

The bot takes in a Wikipedia article title from the user. It scrapes the full article content, then sends it to OpenAI's powerful natural language processing models to produce a summary. The summarization is tuned to focus on key facts rather than creative writing.

# Usage

To use this bot:

1. Clone the repository 
2. Install dependencies
3. Provide OpenAI API key 
4. Run the Python script
5. Input a Wikipedia article title
6. Receive a reliable textual summary

# Future Improvements

Some areas for future improvement:

- Summarization accuracy tuning
- Supporting additional languages 
- User-friendly interface

# About the Project

This project was created to provide an open source tool for generating reliable extracts from Wikipedia. It makes state-of-the-art NLP available for summarization tasks where accuracy is critical.
